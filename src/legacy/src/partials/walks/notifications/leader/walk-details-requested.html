<div ng-controller="WalkNotificationsController" style="font-size:12px">
    <p>Thanks again for offering to lead the walk on <strong ng-bind="walk.walkDate | displayDate" class="nowrap"></strong>!</p>
    <p>Before I can publish your walk, I need more information from you as <strong ng-bind="validateWalk.walkValidations | asWalkValidationsList"></strong>
    <p ng-if="event.reason" ng-bind="event.reason"></p>
    <p>For info, the details of your walk at the moment are as follows:
        <ng-include src="'ekwg-legacy/partials/walks/notifications/common/walk-details.html'"></ng-include>
    </p>
    <p>When you get a moment, please could you complete the above information either directly on the site or by emailing me.
        I'll then give it a quick check, mark it as approved, and then it will be published on our walks programme for all to see.</p>
    <ng-include src="'ekwg-legacy/partials/walks/notifications/common/footer.html'"></ng-include>
</div>
