    <p>This email is to notify you as an Expense Approver, that <strong ng-bind="expenseClaimLatestEvent().memberId | memberIdToFullName : members"></strong>
        has just updated <strong ng-bind="(expenseClaimCreatedEvent().memberId | memberIdToFullName : members) + '\'s'" class="nowrap"></strong>
        EKWG expense claim to a status of <strong ng-bind="expenseClaimLatestEvent().eventType.description"></strong>.
        For reference, the claim was originally created on <span ng-bind="expenseClaimCreatedEvent().date | displayDate" class="nowrap"></span>
        and contains the following <span ng-bind="selected.expenseClaim().expenseItems.length"></span> item(s):
    </p>
    <ng-include src="'ekwg-legacy/partials/expenses/notifications/common/expense-claim-table.html'"></ng-include>
    <p>Because an EKWG expense claim needs 2 stages of approval, it will now need to be approved by a different person
        (e.g. not <span ng-bind="expenseClaimLatestEvent().memberId | memberIdToFirstName : members"></span>). Then Jon will be automatically notified to organise the payment.</p>
